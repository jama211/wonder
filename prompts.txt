I'm planning on making a game, and I want to give you some context first. I want to make a game in c# (making sure to use mono-compatible libraries only for later cross compatibility) that starts with a text based adventure with a green and black retro style text interface. Later though, it will turn into a platformer in place - that means it will be a platformer where you are made of text-like elements and also the platforms etc will be text elements - in fact, the platforms etc will be made out of text. whilst at first it will be typing only, I will later have commands like "look" show the current room layout with words describing what they are but in the physical locations that will be on the screen for the platformer to work with. In fact, I may also have a top down/angled isometric view and have the player walk around the worded objects in the room and interact with them... 

Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start small. Please remember the contexct above, and then make me a basic program that opens a window filled with fake boot-up style green text on a black background that we can use as the starting point for a game. Once it's "booted" it needs to present some initial text (insert anything placeholder for now) and then allow a text input field for the user.
